# Assumtions

The following assumptions were made when turning `Specification/humanSpec.md` into
`AISpec.md` / `prd.json`, since they were not fully specified by the human spec:

1. Default round is a Portsmouth (60 arrows) rather than a WA18; a round-selection
   control is a reasonable future enhancement but not required for v1.
2. Handicap scheme fixed to `"AGB"` (2023 scheme) rather than `"AGBold"`/`"AA"`/`"AA2"`.
3. `n_pass` is restricted to exact divisors of 60 (`1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60`), so
   every pass is the same length and the round divides evenly. Default `n_pass = 12`.
4. Archers are paired strictly in entry order (1v2, 3v4, ...); no bracket/re-pairing UI.
5. Overall match tie-break: majority of passes wins; an even split is shown as a draw,
   with no further tie-break (e.g. sudden-death pass) implemented.
6. Pass-winner tie-break (equal percentile) is: compare raw scores, then coin flip.
7. All match state is in-memory only; no database, no persistence across restarts.
8. Charting (advanced mode) uses `matplotlib` static images rather than a JS charting
   library, to minimise dependencies for a local single-user tool.
9. Bowstyle is collected for display/record-keeping only and never enters any
   calculation, per the explicit exclusion of the bowstyle-variance correction in
   `Specification/humanSpec.md`.

# Implementation History

## Task 1: Project scaffolding and dependencies (complete)
Added Flask, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pytest via `uv add`. Created `h2h/` package
(`app.py` with a `create_app()` factory, placeholder `stats.py` to be filled in by
task 2) and root `main.py` entry point. Verified `uv run main.py` starts a real
server and `GET /` returns 200; verified `h2h.stats` imports without Flask. Tests in
`tests/test_app.py`. No issues.

## Task 2: Per-arrow score PMF from handicap (complete)
Implemented `h2h.stats.per_arrow_pmf`, decomposing the same ring-tail terms
`archeryutils.HandicapScheme._s_bar` uses internally (`exp(-((arrow_radius +
ring_radius)/sigma_r)**2)`) into per-ring hit probabilities instead of just their
mean, by taking successive differences of the ring "tail" (miss-beyond-this-ring)
probabilities. Verified against archeryutils across 5 handicaps x 2 target faces
(Portsmouth, WA18): PMF sums to 1, all probabilities >= 0, and
`sum(score*prob) == archeryutils.arrow_score(handicap, target)` to within 1e-6 -
this numerically confirms the hand-derived telescoping-sum decomposition is
correct. Tests in `tests/test_stats.py`. No issues.

## Task 3: n_pass score distribution via convolution (complete)
Implemented `h2h.stats.n_pass_score_distribution` via exact discrete
self-convolution (`numpy.convolve`) of the per-arrow PMF, n_pass-1 times. Verified
sums to 1, mean scales linearly with n_pass (matches n_pass * archeryutils mean),
n_pass=1 reproduces the input PMF exactly, and n_pass<1 raises ValueError. Tested
at n_pass in {1, 6, 12, 60} (60 being the full round) - even at 60 arrows this is
computationally trivial, so no need for a Gaussian/CLT approximation or Monte
Carlo fallback. Tests in `tests/test_stats.py`. No issues.

## Task 4: Percentile computation and pass-winner decision (complete)
`percentile` (already added in task 2's commit) and the new `decide_pass_winner`
implement the comparison method from Testing/idea_evaluation.md: compare each
archer's percentile under their own distribution, tie-break on raw score, then on
a coin flip (injectable `random.Random` for deterministic testing). Verified
percentiles are bounded in [0,1] and hit their expected extremes, winner-decision
picks the higher percentile, falls back to raw score on a tie, and produces both
outcomes over repeated calls when fully tied. Tests in `tests/test_stats.py`. No
issues.

## Task 5: Match/round data model and orchestration (complete)
Added `h2h/models.py` with `Archer`, `Pass`, `Match`, and `default_round()`
(Portsmouth, per Assumption 1). `Match` validates `n_pass` against the full set of
divisors of 60, pre-computes both archers' n_pass score distributions at
construction time (cheap per task 3), and exposes `record_pass`/`result`/`pass_wins`.
Overall result is majority-of-passes, draw on an even split, per Assumptions 4-5.
Verified invalid n_pass rejection, correct pass count for n_pass=12, tally
updates, majority-wins and even-split-draw outcomes, and that `result()` before
completion raises. Tests in `tests/test_models.py`. No issues; `models.py` is the
first module to depend on `stats.py`, and both remain Flask-independent.
